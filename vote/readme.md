## The Simulation

> Imagine a city with population of 400 voters (small circles) evenly distributed into blocks--20 by 20.

> The city is trying to decide where to put the post office. Candidate locations are represented by the lettered circles on the map.

> __Distance:__ An easy--although undemocratic--way to choose the best location is simply to calculate the average distance from each voter to each candidate. The candidate with the lowest average distance is the best option.

> __Plurality:__ The most obvious democratic method to choose a location is to let voters **vote**. Each voter will make the obvious choice and vote for the candidate location that is closest. The color of each voter reflects the closest candidate.
